                                        --------------------------------------

                                        -Basic commands in Angular

                                1. crreating a project in Angular - ng new project-name

                                2. to run Angular project - ng serve --open

                                3. to generate Component - ng g  c  Component-name

                                4. syntax of setup path - {path:'type path', Component:Component-name}
                                                            inside routes array in AppRoutingModule

                                5. To generate service - ng g s service-name  

                                6. to create pipe - ng g pipe                           

                                        -Basic concept in Angular

                                    1. Module - to import 3rd party libraries - Root Module - AppModule

                                    2. Component - generate html,css,ts -root Component - AppComponent

                                    3. to set up path for Component - use AppRoutingModule

                                    4. Router-outlet selector - to display html in browser according to user request

                                    5. Angular Services - Reusable code that can be shared across components

                                    6. Dependency Injection -  to share data between dependent classes

                                        - syntax: access-specifier variable-name:dependent-class-name
                                        - access specifier - public/private
                                        - inside constructor of a class

                                    7. Asynchronous function - Observable - rxjs library

                                        - resolve state - subscribe()
                                        - reject state - catch()

                                    8. Data Binding - To share within a component
                                        8.1 one way binding - sharing done in only one directon at a time
                                            8.1.1 component(ts) to view (html)
                                                - string interpolation - {{property-name}} in html

                                                - property binding - [attribute-name] = 'property -name' in html


                                            8.1.2 view(html) to component (ts)

                                                -   event binding - (event-name) = "function call()"
                                                -   event binding using $event - (event -name)= "function call($event)"

                                        8.2 two way biding - share only in two direction at a time

                                                - ngModel - Import FormsModule , [(ngModel)]="property -name"

                                    9. Angular Directive - to manipulate DOM

                                        - Component Directive

                                        - structural Directive - to add/remove html elements based on some condition / length of an array

                                            - *ngIf = "condition"

                                            - *ngFor ="let variable-name of array-name"

                                    10. Activated route - provides access to information about a route associated with 
                                        a component that is loaded in an oulet

                                    11. ngForm -  to track the form values

                                    12. pipe - uses pipes to transform  string,
